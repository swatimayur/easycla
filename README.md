# Introduction to EasyCLA

The Contributor License Agreement \(CLA\) service of the Linux Foundation lets project contributors read, sign, and submit contributor license agreements easily.

This repository contains both the backend and front-end UI for supporting and managing the application.

This platform supports both GitHub and Gerrit source code repositories. Additional information can be found in the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/).

## Third-party Services

Besides integration with Auth0 and Salesforce, the CLA system has the following third party services:

* [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/) for CLA agreement e-sign flow
* [Docraptor](https://docraptor.com/) for convert html CLA template as PDF file

## CLA Backend

The CLA project has two backend projects.

The majority of the backend APIs are implemented in python, and can be found in the `cla-backend` directory.

Recent backend development was implemented in Golang, and can be found in the `cla-backend-go` directory. In particular, this backend contains APIs powering Automated Templates, GitHub Whitelists, and Duplicate Company handling in the Corporate Console.

## CLA Frontend

### Overview

CLA frontend consists of three independent SPA build with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) framework.

* `cla-frontend-project-console` for LinuxFoundation director/admin/user to manage project CLA
* `cla-frontend-corporate-console` for any concrete company CCLA manager to sign a CCLA and manage employee CLA whitelist
* `cla-frontend-contributor-console` for any project contributor to sign ICLA or CCLA
